Arithmetic Sequence

An arithmetic sequence is a number sequence that the difference of any two successive numbers is a constant. The following is the formula:

    fn = fn-1 + f
      or
    a, a + f, a + 2f, a + 3f, a + 4f, ... 

example:

    1, 3, 5, 7, 9 11, 13, ... 

The sum of an arithmetic sequence with n members:

    n(f1 + fn)/2
      or
    an + n(n-1)/2 

Geometric Sequence

A geometric sequence is a number sequence that each number after the first is the multiplication of the previous one with a fixed non-zero number. The following is the formula:

    fn = fn-1 * r
      or
    a, ar, ar2, ar3, ar4, ... 

where:

    a is a scale factor
    r is the common ratio 

example:

    1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ... 

The sum of a geometric sequence with n members:

    a(1-rn+1)/(1-r) 

The product of a geometric sequence with n members:

    anr(n(n-1)/2) 

Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a number sequence that the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The following is the formula:

    f0 = 0
    f1 = 1
    fn = fn-1 + fn-2 

the numbers:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
